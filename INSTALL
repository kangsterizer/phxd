Requirements
============

  + Twisted

      * http://twistedmatrix.com/
      * Written and tested with version 1.3, but 2.0 should work

  + MySQL 3.23 - 4.1 (only if using MySQL database)

      * http://www.mysql.com/
      * Written and tested with version 4.0.17

  + MySQLdb (only if using MySQL database)

      * http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
      * Written and tested with version 1.0.0

Installation
============

Once the prerequisites above are installed, running phxd should only be a
matter of editing the "config.py" file for your setup, and possibly sourcing
the "tables.sql" into your MySQL database. If you choose to use the MySQL
database backend, you'll need to set DB_TYPE to "MySQL" and set the other
DB_* variables appropriately. Importing the tables into your MySQL database
may go something like this:

  shell:~/phxd# mysql -udbuser -pdbpass
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE phxd;
  mysql> SOURCE tables.sql;

I would recommend also creating a separate MySQL user for phxd to use, but
that is beyond the scope of this document.

Running phxd
============

Make sure you are in the phxd directory, and type the following:

  python phxd.py

That's it. You're done. If running phxd causes any exceptions to be spewed, it
is most likely a problem with your database configuration. If you want to run
the server in the background, use the following:

  python phxd.py &

Connecting for the first time
=============================

By default, an "admin" account is created with the password "adminpass".
Make sure you log in immediately after running phxd and change the password
or delete the admin account (after creating a privileged account, of course).
